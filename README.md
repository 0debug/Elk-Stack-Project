# Elk-Stack-Project

Linux Scripts, Ansible Scripts+Playbooks, used for the project along with images.

These were used to setup a jumpbox, a server with an Elk Stack container, and servers running DVWA containers.

The objective was to setup multiple different docker containers within cloud servers that we configured.
